# Cable Loss for Timesmicrowave LMR Cables. (for now only LMR-400)

Eeasily calculate the cable loss with the distance of the cable and the frequency as inputs.

timesmicro.functions.cableLoss(frequency=1500, distance=120, rounded=True)

Or plot the ideal function for the cable loss of a cable with the distance as input. (start frequency and stop frequency are optional. L-Band by default).

timesmicro.plot2D.cableLoss(distance=120)
